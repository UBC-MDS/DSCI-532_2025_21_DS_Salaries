# 1. Implemented Features Since Milestone 3
Since Milestone 3, we have introduced several enhancements to improve the functionality, usability, and visual appeal of our dashboard:

- Dynamic Map Updates: The map now updates based on selected filters, providing a more comprehensive geographical analysis.
- Multi-Select Filters: Users can now select multiple options in the filters, allowing for better comparisons across different categories.
- Collapsible Description Section: The description section is now hidden under a collapsible button, freeing up space for clearer visualizations.
- No Data Message: When no data is available, a message is displayed over the graph, guiding users to adjust their selections.
- Improved Line Chart Readability: We rotated the year labels and removed the x-axis labels to optimize space and enhance readability.
- Reset All Filters Button: A new button allows users to reset all filters with a single click, improving usability.


# 2. Alignment with Proposal & Unimplemented Features

We have successfully implemented all the required input and output components outlined in our proposal. However, some modifications were made based on usability testing, data characteristics, and the effectiveness of visual storytelling. These refinements are detailed below.

# 3. Differences from Original Proposal

- The global map was not originally included in our proposal, but we realized that visualizing salary distribution across different countries provides valuable insights into global trend and showing which countries have more resources or jobs for data science. We also applied filters to the map, which makes the map adapts to the selections.

# 4. Known Issues or Bugs

Currently, all dashboard functionalities are working as expected, and there are no known bugs or incomplete features.

# 5. Strengths, Limitations, and Future Improvements

## What Our Dashboard Does Well
Our dashboard effectively provides key insights for data science job seekers by:

- Visualizing salary trends over time to help users understand earnings potential.
- Analyzing salary variations based on employment type, company size, and experience level to support informed career decisions.
- Highlighting high-paying job titles within the data science industry.
- Incorporating interactive visualizations to enhance user engagement and usability.
- Introducing a static world map to display salary distribution by country, aiding job seekers in location-based salary comparisons.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements
- Limited Historical Data: The dataset covers only four years (2020-2023), restricting long-term trend analysis.
    - Future Improvement: Expand the dataset with newer salary records to provide a more comprehensive view of salary evolution.

- Basic Dashboard Design: While functional, the dashboard layout and styling remain relatively simple.
    - Future Improvement: Introduce more advanced design elements, animations, and color schemes to improve aesthetics and engagement.
