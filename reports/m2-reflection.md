# Which parts of your proposal/sketch you have implemented in your dashboard so far and explain what is not yet implemented.

# What you have done differently than in your proposal/sketch explain why (e.g. implementation difficulty, explanation for why the new approach is more effective, etc).

# Do you have anything that is not working in your dashboard? Identify them so that we can distinguish between features in development and bugs.

# If you have intentionally deviated from any of the best practices that we learned in 531 regarding effective visualizations.

# What you think your dashboard does well currently? what its limitations are? What are good potential future improvements and additions?
