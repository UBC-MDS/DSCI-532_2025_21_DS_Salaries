# 1. Implemented Features Since Milestone 2
Since Milestone 2, we have introduced several enhancements to improve the functionality, usability, and visual appeal of our dashboard:

- **Challenging Part**: We added a world map displaying average salaries by location, accessible through a new tab on the main page. This feature was inspired by Group 15 of Retail Pulse and provides valuable insights for job seekers looking to compare salaries across different regions.
- Dynamic Bar Charts: We updated all bar charts to be fully interactive and responsive to filters, improving the dashboard's usability. Additionally, we removed unnecessary decimal points in salary values and reformatted the axis labels to display values in thousands (k) for better readability.
- Refined Layout & Design: We properly aligned elements using a grid layout, particularly improving the top portion of the dashboard. The top navigation bar and sidebar now have a solid background color to enhance visual consistency.
- Improved Labeling: To reduce redundancy, we removed y-axis titles where the information was already conveyed in the graph title.
- Collapsible Text Section: We adjusted the bottom text section to avoid full-width display and placed it within a collapsible button, improving readability and organization.

# 2. Alignment with Proposal & Unimplemented Features

We have successfully implemented all the required input and output components outlined in our proposal. However, some modifications were made based on usability testing, data characteristics, and the effectiveness of visual storytelling. These refinements are detailed below.

# 3. Differences from Original Proposal

- The global map was not originally included in our proposal, but we realized that visualizing salary distribution across different countries provides valuable insights into global trend and showing which countries have more resources or jobs for data science.

# 4. Known Issues or Bugs

Currently, all dashboard functionalities are working as expected, and there are no known bugs or incomplete features.

# 5. Strengths, Limitations, and Future Improvements

## What Our Dashboard Does Well
Our dashboard effectively provides key insights for data science job seekers by:

- Visualizing salary trends over time to help users understand earnings potential.
- Analyzing salary variations based on employment type, company size, and experience level to support informed career decisions.
- Highlighting high-paying job titles within the data science industry.
- Incorporating interactive visualizations to enhance user engagement and usability.
- Introducing a static world map to display salary distribution by country, aiding job seekers in location-based salary comparisons.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements
- Limited Historical Data: The dataset covers only four years (2020-2023), restricting long-term trend analysis.
    - Future Improvement: Expand the dataset with newer salary records to provide a more comprehensive view of salary evolution.

- Basic Dashboard Design: While functional, the dashboard layout and styling remain relatively simple.
    - Future Improvement: Introduce more advanced design elements, animations, and color schemes to improve aesthetics and engagement.
