# **Contributing to the Wine Quality Analysis Project**

This document outlines how to propose changes and contribute to DS Salaries

### Fixing typos

If you are a project contributor, changes like fixing typos or grammatical errors in the
documentation can be made directly using the GitHub web interface.
Ensure you make changes to the appropriate source file.

-   **YES**: Edit a `.md` or `.ipynb` file directly.

-   **NO**: Modify autogenerated files (e.g., HTML files generated from
    `.ipynb` or `.qmd` files).

### Prerequisites

Before making a substantial contribution, always file an issue first to
describe the problem or feature you'd like to address. This helps ensure
the team agrees on its importance.

-   If you've found a bug, provide a minimal reproducible example
    (reprex) or describe it clearly in your issue.

### Pull request process

-   To contribute code or documentation changes:
    1.  **Branching**: Create a separate Git branch for each pull
        request (PR).

    2.  **Style Guide**:

        -   **Python**: Follow the [PEP8 style
            guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

        -   **R**: Follow the tidyverse style guide.

    3.  **Testing**: Ensure any new code is thoroughly tested and
        doesnâ€™t break existing functionality. Include test cases where
        applicable.

    4.  **Submitting a PR**:

        -   Clearly describe the purpose of the pull request.

        -   Reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #issue_number`).

        -   Submit your PR and wait for feedback from maintainers.
